# Mood Board

On my moodboard, I used renaissance paintings with moody colour palettes to represent complexity, passion & storytelling. 
I incorporated some Japanese embroidered silks & ink illustrations to hint at my love of travel, culture & art.

# Wireframes

I created my wireframes using pen & paper - for mobile, tablet & browser.

# Colour Palette

I chose dark purples, deep red, slate grey, & pale gold. These colours convey imagination, passion, boldness, intellect, ambition - while also being a bit feminine.

# Font Selections

I chose a serif font that complemented the dark, moody tone of my site. I wanted a font that would make the user feel like they are reading a book.

# Project Management

Agile methodologies! Trello helped me to keep track of progress, & GitHub helped me to manage my development & integrate finished features.

# Technologies Used

- VS Code - code editor
- GitHub - version control & deployment
- Ubuntu terminal - CLI

# Bugs

- email button has no link to my email addess for privacy reasons - need to create a contact form instead
- in landscape mode on mobile, job title ("Full-Stack Developer") sits on the bottom edge of the header - need to make less ugly by adding extra padding, border space, or repositioning.
- border-thickness, colour & effect of buttons are inconsistent - fix!
- no scrolling button or navigation makes the site less easy to use - add features
